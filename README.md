# io-workers-check-state
 A script that allows you to check the status of a worker using the API

to use you need a token, to get it go here https://cloud.io.net/explorer/devices and select any device.

Open the developer console and in the network tab in the search field write “summary”, open the request information and in the headers tab find the “Token:” parameter, copy its value and paste it into the script.

The token needs to be updated periodically if an error occurs

In the workers.json file, enter the id and names of all your workers

I also added the ability to group workers
